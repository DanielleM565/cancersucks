Search engine to make finding research papers easier 

Using API's from Pub Med https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/home/develop/api/

IDEA: Create a beter search "adanced search engine" to find only the papers to answer a specific question that you have. It should filter subjects base on keywords in abstracts and show only papers in the language requested. MAjority of papers are in PDF format, There's a feature that converts to files into a more readable format for machine learning and AI to come in later. Aslo need a publication date filter to only give you more recent articles. All without paying for subscriptions to journals clubs when you don't know which library will have in the information you need.
